    "text": "I am a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, currently based in Melbourne, Australia. My journey into analytics has been shaped by a blend of business background, curiosity, and a growing interest in how data influences modern decision-making.\nBefore pursuing analytics, I completed a Bachelor of Business Management with a specialisation in Marketing. Through my undergraduate studies, I developed an understanding of consumer behaviour, communication, and strategy but I also began to see how analytical reasoning could enhance these traditional areas of business.\nI come from a business-oriented family, where entrepreneurship has been passed down through generations. Growing up around discussions of strategy, operations, and markets helped me appreciate the practical side of business management from an early age. This environment taught me to think critically, stay adaptable, and value long-term vision.\nDuring my internship, I was introduced to data-driven projects for the first time. I became fascinated by how even small pieces of information could reveal patterns that shaped entire business decisions. That experience encouraged me to shift my focus toward analytics and inspired me to continue developing technical skills that complement my business background.\nAt Monash, I am specialising in areas such as data management, statistical modelling, and problem-solving. I have developed strong technical proficiency in SQL and continue to build my skills in R, data visualisation, and interpretation. My goal is to apply these tools in ways that bring clarity and insight to complex problems, bridging the gap between business understanding and analytical thinking.\nOutside of university, I enjoy exploring Melbourne’s café culture, travelling, and spending time in nature. I believe in lifelong learning, self-improvement, and maintaining balance between academic growth and personal curiosity. Each new experience helps me see the world with a broader perspective and shapes the way I approach both work and life."

    "text": "Analysis\nData Source:\nThe study by van Oldenborgh et al. (2021) combined two complementary data sources:\n\nERA5 reanalysis data – providing observed temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind from 1979 onward, used to calculate the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Monthly Severity Rating (MSR).\n\nCMIP5 and CMIP6 climate-model ensembles – simulating two climates:\n\none representing the current world with greenhouse-gas emissions, and\n\na counterfactual world without anthropogenic forcing.\n\n\nThese datasets allowed direct comparison between observed conditions and what would have occurred in a world without human-driven warming.\nSupporting national statistics from the Bureau of Meteorology (2020) and CSIRO & BOM (2020) provided context on temperature and rainfall anomalies during 2019.\nFindings:\nThe study found something striking: human-induced climate change has made extreme fire-weather conditions at least four times more likely than they were just over a century ago.\nIn simple terms, the same kind of devastating fire season we once considered “rare” has now become much more frequent.\nFigure Figure 1 captures this visually.\nThe four panels show both the observed and modelled trends for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Monthly Severity Rating (MSR) across south-eastern Australia from 1979 to 2020.\nThe green lines represent the 10-year running mean, clearly climbing upwards over time, while the dotted lines mark the extraordinary 2019–20 fire season.\nTogether, these plots tell a powerful story: Australia’s climate has tilted toward hotter, drier, and windier conditions — the perfect recipe for large-scale fires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Reproduced from van Oldenborgh et al. (2021, Fig. 3).\n\n\n\nTable Table 1 lists the different climate-model ensembles used in the study.\nEach model tested both natural-only and all-forcing scenarios, and all pointed to the same conclusion — the rise in fire-weather intensity cannot be explained by natural variability alone.\nInstead, it directly reflects the impact of greenhouse-gas-driven warming.\nTo verify that this observed increase arises from human activity, the study incorporated multiple climate-model ensembles (Table 1).\nEach model independently reproduced similar upward trends when anthropogenic forcing was included, but not when only natural variability was simulated.\nThis confirms that rising greenhouse-gas concentrations are the dominant driver of the increased fire-weather intensity.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Reproduced from van Oldenborgh et al. (2021, Table 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Figure Figure 1 and Table Table 1 show that our modern climate has shifted toward extremes that once seemed unimaginable.\nWhat we witnessed during the Black Summer wasn’t an accident of nature — it was a glimpse into a new reality shaped by human influence.\nThe results make one thing clear: climate change has dramatically raised the baseline risk of severe bushfire weather across Australia."

## Problem description

The **2019–20 Black Summer bushfires** were among the most destructive events in Australia’s recorded history, burning over 18 million hectares and destroying thousands of homes.\
The devastation raised one defining question: *to what extent did human-driven climate change make these catastrophic conditions more likely?*

This post summarises the findings of *van Oldenborgh et al.* (2021), a landmark attribution study that combined historical observations with climate-model simulations to quantify how much global warming influenced the extreme fire weather that fueled Australia’s Black Summer.

## Analysis

**Data Source:**\
The study by **van Oldenborgh et al. (2021)** combined two complementary data sources:

1.  **ERA5 reanalysis data** – providing observed temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind from 1979 onward, used to calculate the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** and **Monthly Severity Rating (MSR)**.\
2.  **CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate-model ensembles** – simulating two climates:
    -   one representing the **current world with greenhouse-gas emissions**, and\
    -   a **counterfactual world without anthropogenic forcing**.

These datasets allowed direct comparison between observed conditions and what would have occurred in a world without human-driven warming.\
Supporting national statistics from the **Bureau of Meteorology (2020)** and **CSIRO & BOM (2020)** provided context on temperature and rainfall anomalies during 2019.

**Findings:**

The study found something striking: **human-induced climate change has made extreme fire-weather conditions at least four times more likely** than they were just over a century ago.  
In simple terms, the same kind of devastating fire season we once considered “rare” has now become much more frequent.

Figure [@fig-1] captures this visually.  
The four panels show both the observed and modelled trends for the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** and **Monthly Severity Rating (MSR)** across south-eastern Australia from 1979 to 2020.  
The green lines represent the 10-year running mean, clearly climbing upwards over time, while the dotted lines mark the extraordinary 2019–20 fire season.  
Together, these plots tell a powerful story: Australia’s climate has tilted toward hotter, drier, and windier conditions — the perfect recipe for large-scale fires.

Table [@tbl-1 ] lists the different **climate-model ensembles** used in the study.  
Each model tested both natural-only and all-forcing scenarios, and all pointed to the same conclusion — **the rise in fire-weather intensity cannot be explained by natural variability alone**.  
Instead, it directly reflects the impact of greenhouse-gas-driven warming.

To verify that this observed increase arises from human activity, the study incorporated multiple climate-model ensembles ([@tbl-1]).\
Each model independently reproduced similar upward trends when anthropogenic forcing was included, but not when only natural variability was simulated.\
This confirms that **rising greenhouse-gas concentrations are the dominant driver** of the increased fire-weather intensity.\

Both Figure [@fig-1] and Table [@tbl-1] show that our modern climate has shifted toward extremes that once seemed unimaginable.  
What we witnessed during the Black Summer wasn’t an accident of nature — it was a glimpse into a new reality shaped by human influence.  
The results make one thing clear: climate change has dramatically raised the baseline risk of severe bushfire weather across Australia.


# Conclusion

The **2019–20 bushfires** were a tragic chapter in Australia’s history, but they also served as a warning.  
The findings of *van Oldenborgh et al.* (2021) show that the extreme heat and fire-weather conditions behind that season have become at least **four times more likely** due to human-caused climate change.  
While natural variability and local factors like vegetation and ignition sources still play a role, the underlying conditions are now far more dangerous than they once were.  

Like many scientific studies, this one has its limitations — for instance, global climate models still struggle to capture local drought patterns and fine-scale regional effects.  
Even so, the evidence from both observations and models points in the same direction: the atmosphere we live in today is warmer, drier, and far more fire-prone.  

Understanding this connection between climate change and bushfire risk is crucial for the years ahead.  
It’s not just about predicting the next fire season — it’s about recognising that we’ve already entered a new era of heightened risk, and acting now to prepare for it.
